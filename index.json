The switching logic was implemented as rules on the openHAB server. This led to problems, if the WLAN does not work reliably. The MQTT messages had a proprietary message format.  From the experience of the summer of 2018 resulted this second version of the üèä Smart Swimming Pool.\n","date":1590624000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1592247934,"objectID":"17b09a9dc5200475d8a306f18e63a0f9","permalink":"https://smart-swimmingpool.github.io/docs/getting-started/","publishdate":"2020-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/docs/getting-started/","section":"docs","summary":"üèä Smart Swimming Pool: Pool automation for Smarter Control of your Swimming Pool\nExample Environment In my setting I have a thermal solar system for heating water and for support of heating environment within the house.","tags":["docs","getting-started","tutorial"],"title":"Getting Started","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Watch Star  GitHub Project \nConfiguration example to use the Smart Swimming Pool system on openHAB.\nFeatures  Switch Modes: Auto, Manual, Boost, Timer Monitor current temparature of pool water and solar heating Configuration of  start and end time of cleaning circulation time max. temparature of pool water min temparature of solar heating hystesis   Compatible with Alexa openHAB Add-on  OpenHAB BasicUI Sitemap    openHAB Pool Automation: Overview openHAB Pool Automation: Settings          Mobile App (openHAB iOS) This configuration running on openHAB iOS App:\n   openHAB Pool Automation: Overview openHAB Pool Automation: Temparature             openHAB Pool Automation: Settings openHAB Pool Automation: Settings          Precondition The Smart Swimming Pool project uses Homie 3.0 based MQTT messaging.
